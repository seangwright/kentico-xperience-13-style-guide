## Custom Page Types

### ðŸ”¶ Page Type Code Names

**Do** name Page Type with a _suffix_ that describes the Page's _purpose_.

**Do** use conventions like **\*Page** for routable Pages, **\*Content** for Pages that are content-only, and **\*Group** for Pages that act as containers for other content-only Pages.

**Why?** Page Type names determine the auto-generated Page Type C# class names used throughout Kentico Xperience applications.

**Why?** Consistent suffixes will help identify classes that represent Pages in the Content Tree, which inherit from the `TreeNode` class.

**Why?** Some Pages in the Content Tree are content-only and don't have their own URL on a site, whereas other Pages will have a unique URL and can be navigated to.

> ðŸ“Œ Examples:
> **CompanyProfilePage** for a Page with content about the site's business, but also has a unique URL and can be routed to via `/company`.
> **VideoContent** for a Page that contains a link to a video, or an embed code and is displayed on other routable Pages, but has no unique URL.
> **VideoContentGroup** for a Page that might have custom content, but also serves as a container for **VideoContent** Pages, and has no unique URL.
