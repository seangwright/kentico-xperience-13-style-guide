# Introduction

Each recommendation in this guide can be categorized in 1 of 2 ways:

- <EssentialIcon /> Essential: These are things a developer should always do.

- <ConsiderIcon /> Consider: These are things a developer should consider.

These recommendations will always include an explanation of **why** it is in the guide. They will include examples of what it would help the developer avoid ❌ and what following the recommendations might look like in practice.

We don't provide any recommendation from the perspective of what should be avoided, since we want to always give a developer _solutions_ and not _impediments_.

> Throughout this guide we also include Notes <PinIcon /> with more detailed explanations of a recommendation.
