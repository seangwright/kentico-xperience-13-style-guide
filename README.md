# Kentico Xperience Style Guide

![Kentico Xperience](./images/kx-logo-by-kentico-hor-color-pos-sz-rgb.png)

This style guide is the result of observations that the Kentico Xperience community has on building applications with Xperience.

It's a high level collection of (slightly) opinionated recommendations, considerations, and avoidances that a developer should follow when working on a Kentico Xperience project.

This style guide is influenced in approach and goals by [style guides](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide) in other [software communities](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/).

The recommendations in this guide come from the Xperience community and not from Kentico. There is no requirement for developers to follow them to ensure a successful project and teams might already have development patterns and guides they use when working with Kentico Xperience.

Consider this guide to be the collective words of wisdom from the Xperience developer community and your own use-case might require alternatives to what we recommend here.

## Style Guide Structure

This guide is separated into areas of concern for developers working with Xperience.

We follow the path most developers will take when starting a new project, touching on each part of the development process and cross-linking between areas when needed.

## Style Guide Language

Each recommendation can be categorized in 1 of 2 ways:

- ✔ Essential: These are things a developer should always do.

- 🔶 Consider: These are things a developer should consider.

These recommendations will always include an explanation of **why** it is in the guide. They will include examples of what it would help the developer avoid ❌ and what following the recommendations might look like in practice.

We don't provide any recommendation from the perspective of what should be avoided, since we want to always give a developer _solutions_ and not _impediments_.

> Throughout this guide we also include Notes 📌 with more detailed explanations of a recommendation.
